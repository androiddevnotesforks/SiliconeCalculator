It's a cloned version of the [Apple calculator](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/calculator/id1069511488) with [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose), but with more attractive graphics, history for calculations, and dark and light theme support.

Design by [SINTHAI](https://www.behance.net/gallery/130717085/The-calculator-) with a slight change.

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture
The architecture used in this project is [Android recommended architecture](https://developer.android.com/courses/pathways/android-architecture),
which I personally believe is a combination of some layers and principles of three architectures MVVM, MVI and Clean, which makes it great.

## üß™ Testing
For this project, **unit**, **integration**, **end-to-end** tests have been written based on the pyramid test in the Android test [codelab](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/advanced-android-kotlin-training-testing-test-doubles#2), and in addition,
a **benchmark** test has been written for the app startup states to measure the effectiveness of using the Baseline Profile.
